This demo is working version of project management application app. I tried to use Ajax requests in order to prevent postbacks to the server side if there is a button click. And also design is responsive that it is adaptive to mobile devices.  
API module of application also useful for integration posibilities (please use top API menu to test demo Json API).
Pattern design is MVC.
